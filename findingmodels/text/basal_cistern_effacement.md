# Basal cistern effacement—`OIFM_OIDM_267712`

**Synonyms:** effacement of basal cisterns, basilar cistern effacement, cisternal effacement, perimesencephalic cistern effacement, basal cistern obliteration, basal cistern effacement

Loss, narrowing, or obliteration of the cerebrospinal fluid–filled basal (perimesencephalic) cisterns on CT or MRI due to mass effect from edema, hemorrhage, or a space-occupying lesion. This finding commonly reflects elevated intracranial pressure and may indicate increased risk of transtentorial herniation; the original phrasing 'basal cistern effacement' is an example of this imaging appearance.
