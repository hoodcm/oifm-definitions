MTA-scale for Medial Temporal Lobe Atrophy (Scheltens Classification)

**Codes:** RADELEMENT RDES151 mta-scale for medial temporal lobe atrophy (scheltens classification)

## Attributes

### Mta scale—`OIFMA_CDE_001004`

The MTA-score (Scheltens) should be rated on coronal T1-weighted images, on a slice through the corpus of the hippocampus (level of the anterior pons). The scale is based on a visual score of the width of the choroid fissure, the width of the temporal horn, and the height of the hippocampal formation.
For patients that are less than 75 years: score 2 or more is abnormal. For patients that are older than 75 years: score 3 or more is abnormal.
  
*(Select one)*

- **MTA 0**: Score 0: no atrophy.  
- **MTA 1**: Score 1: only widening of choroid fissure.  
- **MTA2**: Score 2: also widening of temporal horn of lateral ventricle.  
- **MTA 3**: Score 3: moderate loss of hippocampal volume (decrease in height).  
- **MTA 4**: Score 4: severe volume loss of hippocampus .   
- **indeterminate**  
- **unknown**
