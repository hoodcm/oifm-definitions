# Pulmonary opacity—`OIFM_OIDM_478641`

**Synonyms:** lung opacity, opacification of the lung, lung opacities, pulmonary opacity

Pulmonary opacity denotes an area of increased radiodensity within the lung parenchyma on chest radiographs or CT, which may be focal or diffuse. It is a non-specific finding with a broad differential including atelectasis, edema, infectious consolidation, hemorrhage, or neoplasm; the term 'pulmonary opacity' exemplifies this non-specific opacification.
